# AnimalShelterProject

Spec:

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner.
The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

- List all of their animals and their admission date
- Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
- Assign an animal to a new owner
- List all the owners and their adopted animals
- CRUD actions for animals/owners
